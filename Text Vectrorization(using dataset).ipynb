Like the first suspension last month , this time also the reason is significant number of passengers from India testing positive on arrival in Hong Kong.\\u201cHong Kong civil aviation authority has advised AI not to operate for two weeks from till October 3. Only one flight was scheduled to operate in this period \\u2014 Delhi-Hong Kong on Monday (September 21) which has been cancelled and passengers informed,\\u201d said a senior AI official.Last month also Hong Kong had barred Air India flights for two weeks after 11 passengers who flew in there from Delhi on August 14 had tested positive on arrival. Cathay Pacific is not operating to India during the pandemic.Chinese media reports Hong Kong has temporarily suspended Cathay Dragon (Cathay\\u2019s regional arm) flights on Kuala Lumpur route. Five people flew AI Express to Malaysia and then took a connecting flight to Hong Kong, where they tested positive on arrival, according to those reports.Last week Dubai aviation authorities had decided to suspend AI Express operations to the city for 15 days after the budget airline twice flew passengers with Covid positive reports there from India. Following an apology from AI Express and assurance that the same will not happen again, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority revoked this suspension.Last Friday, the airline\\u2019s spokesperson had said: \\u201cWe have apologised for the two lapses to Dubai authorities and assured them of putting in place multi-level strict checks to ensure the same does not get repeated. (Accordingly) all AI Express flights from and to Dubai will operate as per original schedule from Saturday (September 19).\\u201d\",\n          \"An edited image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowing in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping with folded hands is being shared on social media.

A clarification was later issued by the Prime Minister's Office about 'the mischievous interpretation of PM's statement.'\\n\\n\\n\\nFact check\\n\\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the photograph and found this PTI photo taken during Modi and Xi Jinping's 2019 meeting at Mamallapuram. The Hindu also published the photo in an article describing Modi and Xi Jinping's Mamallapuram visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the original image, the Indian Prime Minister can be seen interacting with Xi Jinping while security guards stand behind them.\\n\\nBelow is an image comparison of the morphed image (left) and the original image (right).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso Read: No This Photo Is Not Of Indian Troops Killed In Galwan Valley\\n\\nThe image of PM Modi bowing with folded hands is originally from 2014, where he was exchanging greetings with the then Mayor of Tumkur, Geeta Rudresh in the airport. BOOM found a cached version of a 2014 article in Vijay Karnataka which featured the image. The article reported that the prime minister had visited Tumkur to inaugurate the India Food Park.\\n\\nThe same image was fact-checked by BOOM Hindi earlier. Social media posts had then falsely claimed that PM Modi was pictured bowing to industrialist Gautam Adani's wife, Priti Adani.\\n\\nBOOM has fact-checked various other claims in the aftermath of the
