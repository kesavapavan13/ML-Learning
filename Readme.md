📘 Data Preprocessing – Handling Missing Values

This notebook focuses on cleaning the dataset by identifying and handling missing values, which is a crucial step before performing analysis or building machine learning models.

🔹 Key Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset and examined its structure and data types

Identified missing values across numerical and categorical features

Analyzed the proportion and distribution of missing data

Visualized missing values and data patterns using plots

Applied appropriate handling techniques:

Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing values

Imputing missing values using mean, median, or mode based on feature type

Verified the dataset after preprocessing to ensure completeness and consistency

🔹 Libraries Used

Pandas – data loading, manipulation, and missing value handling

NumPy – numerical computations and imputation support

Matplotlib – basic data visualization

Seaborn – statistical and missing value visualizations

This step prepares a clean and reliable dataset for further analysis and machine learning workflows.
