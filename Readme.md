# 📘 Data Preprocessing – Handling Missing Values

This notebook focuses on cleaning the dataset by identifying and handling missing values, which is a crucial step before performing analysis or building machine learning models.

## 🔹 Key Steps Performed

- 📂 Loaded the dataset and examined its structure and data types  
- 🔍 Identified missing values across numerical and categorical features  
- 📊 Analyzed the proportion and distribution of missing data  
- 📈 Visualized missing values and data patterns using plots  
- 🛠️ Applied appropriate handling techniques:
  - ❌ Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing values  
  - 🧮 Imputing missing values using **mean**, **median**, or **mode** based on feature type  
- ✅ Verified the dataset after preprocessing to ensure completeness and consistency

## 🔹 Libraries Used

- 🐼 **Pandas** – data loading, manipulation, and missing value handling  
- 🔢 **NumPy** – numerical computations and imputation support  
- 📉 **Matplotlib** – basic data visualization  
- 🌊 **Seaborn** – statistical and missing value visualizations
